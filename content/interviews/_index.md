## Landmark Interviews

### BBC Proof Session (May 2, 2016)

The most significant interview in Wright's public career. Wright gave BBC journalist Rory Cellan-Jones an exclusive interview in which he promised "extraordinary proof to an extraordinary claim" that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright provided what the BBC initially reported as digitally-signed messages using encryption keys from Bitcoin's early days.

- **Gavin Andresen**, Bitcoin's lead developer after Satoshi, was convinced: "I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi."
- Security researchers **Dan Kaminsky** and **Jeff Garzik** identified the proof as a scam -- Wright had simply **reused an old signature** from a 2009 Bitcoin transaction.
- Wright subsequently asked journalists to send bitcoin to Satoshi's address, promising to return it. He then published a blog post: **"I do not have the courage."**

### Wired / Gizmodo Investigations (December 2015)

The parallel investigations that first publicly identified Wright as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto candidate. Based on leaked documents, blog posts, and email correspondence.

- **Wired** retracted key claims within 24 hours, citing "inconsistencies in the evidence."
- Hours later, Australian Federal Police raided Wright's home and offices.
