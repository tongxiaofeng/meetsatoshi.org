## SANS Reading Room Papers (2005--2008)

Wright published five papers through the SANS Institute Reading Room during the period immediately preceding Bitcoin's creation. These papers focus on enterprise security management, legal compliance, and malware analysis.

| Date | Title |
|------|-------|
| Sep 3, 2005 | Implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) Training process |
| Jan 9, 2006 | Electronic Contracting, New Wine in Old Bottles |
| Oct 1, 2006 | A Quantitative Time Series Analysis of Malware and Vulnerability Trends |
| Oct 2007 | Requirements for Record Keeping and Document Destruction in a Digital World (84 pages) |
| Jan 30, 2008 | Trusting electronically signed documents |
| Apr 2008 | Internet Intermediary Liability |

**Note**: While some of these papers touch on topics tangentially related to Bitcoin's underpinnings (digital signatures, electronic records), they focus primarily on enterprise IT compliance rather than the peer-to-peer cryptographic currencies, proof-of-work systems, or distributed consensus mechanisms being discussed on the cryptography mailing list where Bitcoin's concepts were developed.

## Patent Portfolio (nChain)

Wright is associated with **nChain's** extensive blockchain patent portfolio:

- **3,900+** patents and applications across **46 jurisdictions**
- **450+** patent families representing distinct inventions
- Covers 14 technology areas from core blockchain infrastructure to IoT integration
- Wright's earliest patent filing dates to **October 2011** (document registry system)
- nChain's "Patent Pledge" provides royalty-free access only for Bitcoin SV implementations

The 2024 COPA v Wright judgment resulted in injunctions preventing Wright from asserting Bitcoin-related IP claims, though nChain's patents themselves remain legally valid.
