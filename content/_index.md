**Meet Satoshi** is a comprehensive archive of all publicly available content from Craig Steven Wright (CSW) -- the Australian computer scientist who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

In **March 2024**, the UK High Court [ruled definitively](https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/copa-v-wright/) that Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, finding he had engaged in forgery "on a grand scale."

This site collects and organizes his public record across blogs, social media, videos, interviews, conferences, academic papers, and legal proceedings.
