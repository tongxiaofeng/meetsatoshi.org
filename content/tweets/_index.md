## Account History

### @ProfFaustus (2010--2017)

Wright's earliest known Twitter presence used the pseudonym "Prof Faustus" -- a reference to Christopher Marlowe's *Doctor Faustus*. This same alias was used across other platforms including Facebook (now deleted) and Medium.

### @Dr_CSWright (2017--2024)

Wright's primary and most active Twitter account during the period of his most prominent public Satoshi claims and BSV advocacy. Used for:

- Asserting Satoshi Nakamoto identity
- Promoting Bitcoin SV
- Engaging with (and often antagonizing) the broader Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community
- Commenting on legal proceedings
- Sharing blog posts and academic papers

**Deactivated** in September 2024 following the devastating COPA v Wright judgment that ruled he is not Satoshi Nakamoto and had engaged in forgery "on a grand scale."

### @CsTominaga (2024--present)

After deactivating @Dr_CSWright, Wright moved to a new account using the name "S Tominaga" -- an apparent reference to Satoshi Tominaga, maintaining the Satoshi connection.
