## What is Meet Satoshi?

Meet Satoshi is a comprehensive public archive dedicated to collecting and organizing all publicly available content from Craig Steven Wright (CSW), the Australian computer scientist who has claimed since 2016 to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.

## Who is Craig Steven Wright?

Craig Steven Wright (born 1970) is an Australian computer scientist, businessman, and self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin. His career spans IT security consulting, academic research, and blockchain technology. Key facts:

- **Early career**: IT security at OzEmail (1996), Australian Stock Exchange (1997--1998), and private consulting.
- **Certifications**: 18 SANS Institute/GIAC certifications including world's first GIAC Compliance and Audits certification; GSE-Malware (1 of 4 worldwide in 2008).

### The Satoshi Claim

Wright first came to public attention in **December 2015** when Wired and Gizmodo published parallel investigations identifying him as a potential Satoshi Nakamoto candidate. In **May 2016**, he publicly claimed to be Satoshi in a BBC interview, but his cryptographic "proof" was exposed as a reused transaction signature. In **March 2024**, the UK High Court definitively ruled in COPA v Wright that **Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto**, finding he had "lied to the court repeatedly and extensively" and engaged in forgery "on a grand scale."

## Why This Archive?

There is a vast amount of content spread across many platforms -- blog posts, tweets, videos, interviews, conference talks, academic papers, court documents, and more. Much of this content is at risk of disappearing as accounts are deactivated, websites go offline, and platforms change. This project aims to bring it all together in one searchable, well-organized location.

## Scope

We collect content from the following sources:

- **Blogs**: craigwright.net, gse-compliance.blogspot.com, Medium, Substack, and others
- **Social Media**: Twitter/X, LinkedIn
- **Video Platforms**: YouTube, conference recordings, CoinGeek TV
- **Interviews**: Media appearances across text, audio, and video
- **Academic**: Papers, research publications, SANS Reading Room
- **Legal**: Publicly available court documents and testimonies
