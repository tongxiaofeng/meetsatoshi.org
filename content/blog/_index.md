## Blog Platforms

### gse-compliance.blogspot.com (2008--2015)

Wright's earliest known blog, focused on information security and compliance topics.

- **Status**: Deleted. Partial copies preserved on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/).
- **Notable content**:
  - **Aug 2008**: Post discussing plans to publish a "cryptocurrency paper" and "triple entry accounting" -- two months before Bitcoin's whitepaper publication.
  - **Oct 5, 2008**: Post about passing the GSE-Malware exam after returning from the US.
  - **Nov 2008**: Post mentioning a PGP key.
  - **Jan 10, 2009**: "Bitcoin Beta" post -- later found to be **backdated**; the post only exists in archives from 2014 onward.
- **Archival note**: Cached copies were only captured in November--December 2015, coinciding with Wright's emergence as a Satoshi claimant. This late archival raises authenticity concerns about post dates.
- The blog was notably **inactive during 2009--2011**, the period when Satoshi Nakamoto was most actively developing and promoting Bitcoin.

### craigwright.net (2019--2024)

Wright's primary blog during the BSV era.

- **Status**: Now displays a **court-ordered notice** following the 2024 COPA v Wright ruling.
- **Categories**: Bitcoin & Blockchain Tech, Economics, Law & Regulation, Math.
- Multiple posts asserting Satoshi identity and promoting BSV.

### drcraigwright.net (2015--2016)

Earlier personal website, active during the period surrounding the initial Satoshi revelations.

- **Status**: Defunct / redirected.

### Medium Accounts (2017--2020)

Wright used multiple Medium accounts over several years:

| [@adam_selene](https://medium.com/@adam_selene) | 2017 | Earlier alias account |
| [@craig_10243](https://medium.com/@craig_10243) | 2018--2020 | Primary account; posted as "Craig Wright (Bitcoin SV is Bitcoin.)" |

## The Conversation (2011+)

Wright maintained a profile on The Conversation as Adjunct Lecturer at Charles Sturt University.

- **Profile**: [theconversation.com/profiles/craig-s-wright-3334](https://theconversation.com/profiles/craig-s-wright-3334)
- **Joined**: July 26, 2011
- **Output**: 5 articles, 112 comments
- **Significance**: Contains Wright's **first genuine, untampered public references to Bitcoin** (Jul/Aug 2011). Key observations:
  - Misspelled Bitcoin as "Bit Coin" (two words), while Satoshi consistently used one word.
  - Listed Bitcoin last among PayPal alternatives, suggesting unfamiliarity.
  - Criticized WikiLeaks for not using Bitcoin -- directly contradicting Satoshi's documented December 2010 opposition to WikiLeaks adopting Bitcoin.
  - Writing voice described as "pro-capitalist, anti-hacktivist and pro-corporate," contrasting with Satoshi's patient, respectful tone.

## Key Blog Post Analysis

### The Backdated "Bitcoin Beta" Post (Jan 2009)

A blog post on gse-compliance.blogspot.com dated January 10, 2009 -- the day after Bitcoin's genesis block -- titled "Bitcoin Beta" was found to have been **retroactively created**. The post does not appear in any web archive until 2014, strongly suggesting it was fabricated years later to support Wright's Satoshi claim.

### The PGP Key Blog Insertion

Researcher **Gwern Branwen** used Google Reader caches to prove that a PGP key was **retroactively inserted** into one of Wright's blog posts sometime after 2013 -- in 2013, the key did not exist in the post. This key was later presented as evidence of Wright's Satoshi identity.
